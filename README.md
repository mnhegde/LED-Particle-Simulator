# LED-Particle-Simulator

This is the repository for our final project for CICS 256: a LED Gravity and Particle Simulator using the FeatherS2 Neo, a 16x16 Adafruit LED matrix, and an IMU. More information about the project and a demo of the device can be found on our [website](https://sites.google.com/umass.edu/gravity-and-particle-simulator/home).
